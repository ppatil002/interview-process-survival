## Books about technical interviews :book:

### De-Coding the Technical Interview Process
[Emma Bostian](https://twitter.com/EmmaBostian?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) created a frontend
focused book about the technical interview process. The book contains a lot of examples in Javascript.
Data structures and Algorithms are also part of the book. I used this when I was preparing for my recent interview processes.

### Cracking the Coding Interview
This Book by [Gayle Laakmann MCDowell](https://twitter.com/gayle?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
is a resource that has been recommended by a lot of other devs. I haven't read it (yet) but as far as I know, this book
contains examples in Java and unlike the Book from Emma Bostian, this is not frontend focused.
