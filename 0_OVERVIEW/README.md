# 0. Overview :page_facing_up:

If you landed here, I guess you want to start, or you're already applying for jobs.
In this directory I'll give you a short overview of the topics I'm including
and why I think they're important. If you have a specific topic you're looking for, feel free to jump right into it.


## Topics in this Guide

+ [Strategy :chart_with_upwards_trend:](/1_STRATEGY/README.md)  
  In my opinion having a strategy for applying is super useful. Being sure about what you want and what you have to
  offer will increase your chance to find a great match.
  
+ [CV :pencil:](/2_CV)
  Your CV is the first (and often the only) thing a recruiter sees. Most CVs get a short screening of
  only a few seconds, before the first decision is made. Putting some effort in your CV can make the difference 
  if you make it to a process or not.
  
+ [Job Boards :mag:](/3_JOB_BOARDS)
  Researching job listings can be overwhelming, especially with tons of job boards,
  advertisements and recruiters reaching out to you. This is an overview of job boards with some additional info.
  
+ [Cover Letter :envelope:](/4_COVER_LETTER)
  A cover letter is often optional, but I will point out why I think you should
  always write a cover letter and what to include.
  
+ [Interview Prep :microphone:](/5_INTERVIEW_PREP)
  In most application processes you will have different kinds of interviews.
  Preparation is necessary for all kinds of interviews, not just technical.
  
+ [Coding Task Prep :dart:](/6_CODING_TASK_PREP)
  In some interview processes you'll get asked to do a coding task. Knowing what to expect and 
  how to prepare (especially with limited time) is going to make it a lot easier.

+ [Resources :hammer:](/7_RESOURCES)
  You can find some resources here that I found useful or that have been recommended a lot by other developers.
  I'm going to update this section on a regular basis.
