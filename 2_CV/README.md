## Why I believe it's important to put effort in your CV
Your CV is the first thing a Recruiter sees and often your CV only gets a few seconds of attention before the first decision is made.
If you can make a good impression with your CV in a few seconds, your chances to get [interviewed](/5_INTERVIEW_PREP) increase.


## Tools and Programs to create a CV

There are tons of tools and templates on the internet, it can be overwhelming easily. Get yourself some inspiration (f.e. on etsy) and
decide what kind of style you prefer. You can buy or get a free template, or just make your own.
All you need is a text editor.
There are also CV builders like resume.io or Canva with some templates to choose. 
However, if you want an individual one, make your own :fire:


## DOS & DON'TS

A few things to consider when you create your CV :sunglasses:

### DOS :white_check_mark:

+ use bullet points
+ make it 1 page
+ cut out all irrelevant work experience
+ add relevant skills and transferable skills
  if you don't have relevant skills from previous working experiences because you're just about
  to break into tech, think about your transferable skills from other jobs and highlight these.
+ put in all your contact information
+ include your availability date and salary expectation
+ follow a clear structure
+ include your github & personal portfolio if you have
  having a portfolio and/or github page where you show some of your work
  can be very beneficial. especially if you have little to no working experience, this makes
  you stand out.
+ make it easy to understand how great you are
+ use a similar design with your [cover letter](/4_COVER_LETTER)
+ save as PDF when you're done

### DONT'S :x:

+ make it longer than one page (unless you have 10 or more years of **relevant** work experience)
+ clutter the CV with information (2-4 bullet points per job are enough)
+ unclear structure and cryptic description of previous jobs
+ save as a different format than PDF (some text editors format different from others and can mess up your CV)


## Review :repeat_one:

Try to get some Feedback on your CV (friends, family, colleagues, fellow students). Asking 1-3 other people
for Feedback on your CV can be very beneficial. If you get useful Feedback you can improve your CV once again, before you apply.
