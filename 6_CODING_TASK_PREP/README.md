# Coding Task Prep :dart:

In a technical interview process there's a chance you get asked to do a coding task.
Even if you can't know what the task will be, you can still do a few steps to be prepared.
This will make it easier for you to schedule a coding task next to work or other commitments :clock1:

## Prepare your computer :computer:

Is your computer ready to do some coding?

* [ ]  you have a dedicated workspace and computer/laptop
* [ ]  IDE is up to date and running
* [ ]  git is installed
* [ ]  node.js is installed
* [ ]  you have a github or bitbucket account to upload results

## Time Management :hourglass_flowing_sand:

If you got a coding task, it's common to get 1-2 weeks of time to do it. Even if the task itself won't take
that long, it can be stressful if you have work, children or other commitments.
Figure out on which days you can make 1-2 hours of time to work on the task. Block that time in your calendar
and try to make sure (if that's possible for you) that you don't get interrupted during that time.

## Clarification

Read the instructions thorough. Make sure you understand the task. If you are unsure about something make sure to
reach out to your contact person from the company and ask.

## Documentation

Add a Readme.md file to your project and document your steps of the task. Give some insight of your
thought process. You can also add meaningful comments to your commit messages.

## Clean code

Try to write clean code in your coding task. Use meaningful names for files, variables and functions. Avoid repetitions
and extremely long functions that do 6786 different things. Instead, use small functions that use the single responsibility
principle. 

## Tests

If you have the time, test your code. It's better to add a few small unit tests than having no tests at all.
This will show the developers that you care about testing when you code.
